# Tasks for Coding Exercise

Create a simple Flutter app that has basic social capabilities

A user centric view where they can see their profile
Screen for listing mock posts from friends and a detail view of the posts
Placeholders for what good data structures for users and posts and friends

# Thoughts

I am moldable and adaptable, and can pick up on established patterns quickly. In this coding exercise, to stay true to the time limit, I am using patterns I am used to with reducing scope.

I stepped out of scope and spent 15-20 minutes on a user profile posts section, which wasn't listed in the coding exercise... My mistake..

I started with the user profile, as a user is needed before posts can be made.
